'Before Dark' is a service that sends SMS reminders at intervals of your choice before sunset. Simply enter a phone number, select intervals to be notified at and hit submit. Before Dark will then send messages at intervals selected. It's that simple.

Before Dark was developed by Harjot Singh, Jake Sieradzki, Daniel Vaughan, Maya and Asha Wills for #YRS2014 Festival of Code. With thanks to all the team at Cyber-Duck and the Twilio team for their support.
